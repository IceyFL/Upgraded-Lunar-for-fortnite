This is just a project for myself so if you want to use it use the requirements file and look for any extra libraries used in the aimbot.py file.
It has extra features such as show fov and triggerbot.
Use f1 to toggle aimbot, f2 to close program, f3 to toggle menu, f4 to toggle triggerbot once it is enabled in the menu.
